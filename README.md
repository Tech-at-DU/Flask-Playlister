# Playlister (Video Playlist) App

## What you will learn

You might have heard of the video site [YouTube](https://youtube.com) where millions of people have watched billions of hours of music, vlogs, how-tos, and videos of cats acting like cats. We are going to piggyback on their success and create a **YouTube Video Playlist app**, aka **Playlister**, so that you can keep track of your favorites and share with your friends.

By finishing this tutorial you will continue to deepen your knowledge of Flask as well as master the internet-wide paradigms of RESTful and Resourceful routing. You will be Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting (CRUD) a single `Playlist` resource. You will also learn how to use a MongoDB document-based database with PyMongo.

Let's jump in and bootstrap our Flask app and add a templating engine.

After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:

* Use the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern to create single resource application.
* Create all the RESTful routes of a single resource.
* Save data using a NoSQL/Document-based database called MongoDB.
* Push a project live using Heroku.
* Understand how to use Bootstrap for basic styling
